# Detecting-malicious-URLs-using-different-ML-models


Analysis of the FIFA World Cup 2018 data in order to find which factors (variables) influence a country to be closer to the first place. 

## Datasets used:

**Malicious URLs dataset** provided on Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/sid321axn/malicious-urls-dataset
Dataset included only two columns: url and type so feature engineering was needed.

*Acknowledgments*: Majority of work done in private jupyter notebook repo in Faculty platform provided by University College London.

# Dependency

- Python 3.8, 3.7
- Jupyter Notebook 

# Usage

``` Anaysis_URLs (2).ipynb ``` is the full end-to-end machine learning project including all the steps from cleaning, to training the models and fine-tuning them <br />
